we get a photo with numbers : 
16, 9, 3, 15, 3, 20, 6 {20, 8, 5, 14, 21, 13, 2, 5, 18, 19, 13, 1, 19, 15, 14}
actually we know starts with picoctf, we can see one thing number 3 is twice in this part and in fact c is third in alphabet so we pretty much know how the cipher works, it give each number a letter from the alphabet chronically 

if we use any online tool for that we get :
