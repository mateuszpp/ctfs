after connecting via netcat we have a market
we have 40 coins and few options to buy and sell as well
on the second position we can see an item named Fruitful flag, however its price is 100 
and we have only 40 coins, without even looking at a source code i tried to but negative amout of any item so that the program hopefully would give me money instead of taking from me 
and indeed this happened.
this way i farmed money and bought a fruitful flag and was given with a flag in ascii
