wow - this exercise is actually really cool 
when we use netcat we see some code which every line start with G, we are also given a hint that 
it is written in CNC machine language, if we browse for such we are given a results of a gcode, and this is the case.
i couldnt find any terminal tool to decode Gcode and the reason is very simple the gcode decoding gives us results either in 2 or 3d, if we use an online tool we are given the flag in a way a machine would write it, looks pretty cool to me 
flag : picoCTF{num3r1cal_c0ntr0l_a067637b}
