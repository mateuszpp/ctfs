Here is a PDF file that seems to have some problems. I'm not sure what it used to be, but that's not important. I know it contains the flag, but I'm sure you can find it and drag it out of the file somehow. This is a two-step flag as you will find it partially encoded.

we can see the flag is encoded in hexadecimal, however if we dont know the encode we can always try dencode
